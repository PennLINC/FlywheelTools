# Methods

Flywheel tools is a multiple purpose toolkit for interacting with the Flywheel
platform. The toolkit allows users to follow a reproducible workflow for BIDS
curation and audit of their data, that includes 1) inspection of sequences; 2)
design of a curation heuristic; 3) heuristic testing and implementation; 3)
curated data inspection and export; and finally 4) audit of data and analyses.

## Programming Languages & Technologies

Flywheel Tools is built primarily in Python 3.6 **[CITE]()** due to its ease of
use in interfacing with the Flywheel SDK. Additionally, R 3.4.1, with its
extensive variety of libraries for creating high-quality data analysis reports,
is used for HTML report generation **[CITE]()**. The majority of SDK users on
the Flywheel platform utilise Python as their programming language of choice *is
there a reference for this?*, allowing members of the community to view and
contribute to the open-source codebase *When I read this I got confused for a
second thinking you were talking about the FlyWheel SDK codebase. That's
definitely NOT easy to contribute to because it's all swagger! That might be
worth pointing out here, that unlike the actual Flywheel SDK, your suite of
tools are standard Python/R packages that are easy to contribute to*. For
reprodicibility and workflow management, Flywheel Tools' modules are packaged in
version controlled software containers built and managed in Docker **[CITE]()**.
Lastly, the Flywheel Tools package relies on users adopting the Brain Imaging
Data Structure (BIDS) paradigm to curate their data. BIDS is a paradigm for
reproducible and collaborative data storage and is growing rapidly in the
neuroimaging community **[CITE]()**, and hence BIDS compatibility is included on
the Flywheel platform.

## Flywheel

Flywheel is a big data management and analysis platform for research, which
lends itself well to neuroimaging. The platform focuses heavily on collaborative
and reproducible science. User-facing components of the platform itself are the
Web User Interface (UI), the Software Development Kit (SDK), and the Application
Programming Interface (API) ([IMAGE HERE]()).

### Flywheel Web UI

The web UI is accessible through any modern web browser and is the primary
method of interacting with Flywheel data. Through this point-and-click
interface, users are able to upload, view, download, and analyse data with ease
and simplicity. However, accomplishing tasks with many repetitive steps or a
large number of subjects/sessions to iterate over can be tiresome and
error-prone. Alongside knowledge of navigating the web UI, many users also make
use of the SDK to munge and analyse data programmatically.

### Flywheel API & SDK

Flywheel's database utilises MongoDB for data storage and access, meaning that
all Flywheel data is represented by hierarchical relationships between document
objects. This has allowed developers to create and store complex structures with
ease, and query data rapidly **[CITE]()**. In order to access this data,
Flywheel uses a RESTful Application Programming Interface (REpresentational
State Transfer) **[CITE]()**, and hence each document or data object is
accessible through a a specific URL that a web browser or SDK can access by
requesting the data and waiting for a response from the server. The Flywheel
Python SDK provides a powerful interface for inspecting, munging, and
manipulating data through this API, by standardising this underlying data model
into Pythonic Objects, the flywheel SDK is effectively an object relationship
mapper (ORM) somewhat similar to the popular SQLAlchemy package. Programming
with the Python SDK involves objects and methods that any user with Python
programming experience can quickly pick up.
*this is an excellent summary of flywheel. We should check with them about how
much of this is ok to include in a public paper. is some of it trade secrets?*

### Flywheel Data Model

Once abstracted in Python, Flywheel's data model is simple and should be
familiar to neuroimaging researchers. Objects follow a specific hierarchical
structure **([IMAGE]())** â€” at the top level is the FlyWheel *instance*, a
process running that serves the API to users (for example, a
University). Within the FlyWheel instance, there are multiple *groups*, which
are typically a lab or collection or research that collaborate on one of more
*projects*. Each project object can have one or
many subjects (i.e. participants), and each subject can have one or many
sessions (i.e. scanning visits). Within a session, there may be one or many
acquisition objects which describe the scanning sequence collected during a
particular or examination (e.g. rs-fMRI, DWI, PET), and under each acquisition
is *attached* the data file associated with the sequence (e.g. a NIfTI file).
Note that a file can be attached to any object type, and each object can have
metadata associated with it. Hence, a subject object may have de-identified
demographic metadata associated to that participant, and the object may also
have a self-report scale attached to it as a text file. A notable exception to
the hierarchical structure rule is the analysis object, which behaves in much
the same way as others but can be a child object of any other object, allowing
researchers to create analyses of entire projects, for example, each with their
own associated metadata and files (such as inputs and outputs).

Abstracting this data model in Python results in simple hierarchical objects,
each with setter's and getter's for handling metadata and files, and methods for
accomplishing object-specific tasks like traversing the hierarchical structure
or running analyses. Flywheel Tools' modules make use of this data model to
accomplish a wide range of tasks.

### Flywheel Gears

Flywheel encourages the use of pre-packaged analysis workflows called *gears*.
These gears are run by virtual machines using Docker and hence are
version-controlled and software/platform agnostic **[CITE]()**. In addition to
the multitude of gears available on the platform, users are able to package
their own software in a gear and use it for running analysis workflows on their
Flywheel data, via the web UI or SDK. Deciding on whether to accomplish a task
using the web UI, programmatically using the SDK, or by wrapping it as a
workflow into a gear, depends on the complexity and frequency of the task
**[IMAGE]()**.

# Results

We implemented the Flywheel Tools package using the Flywheel SDK to enable easy
inspection, curation, validation, and audit of Flywheel data through a handful
of user-friendly gears and command-line tools.

The first module of the package is called `fw-heudiconv`, and is largely
inspired by the popular HeuDiConv Python package **[CITE]()**. `fw-heudiconv` is
a multi-part toolbox for reprodicible curation of neuroimaging data into BIDS on
Flywheel. The second module, `flaudit`, is a tool for accomplishing a complete
audit of a Flywheel project, giving users a view of their dataset from 10,000
feet.
