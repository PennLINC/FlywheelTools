# Methods

Flywheel tools is a multiple purpose toolkit for interacting with the Flywheel platform. The toolkit allows users to follow a reproducible workflow for curation and audit of their data, that includes 1) inspection of sequences; 2) design of a curation heuristic; 3) heuristic testing and implementation; 3) curated data inspection and export; and finally 4) audit of data and analyses.

## Programming Languages

Flywheel Tools is built in Python 3.6 due to its ease of use in interfacing with the Flywheel SDK. Additionally, R 3.4.1, with its extensive variety of libraries for creating high-quality data analysis reports, is used for audit report generation. The majority of SDK users on the Flywheel platform utilise Python as their language of choice, allowing members of the community to view and contribute to the open-source codebase.

## Flywheel SDK

Flywheel's database utilises MongoDB for data storage and access, meaning that all Flywheel data is represented by hierarchical relationships between document objects. This allows developers to create and store complex structures with ease, and query data rapidly. The Flywheel SDK provides a powerful interface able to inspect, munge, and manipulate data.
