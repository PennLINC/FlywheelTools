TITLE={LORIS: a web-based data management system for multi-center studies},

JOURNAL={Frontiers in Neuroinformatics},

VOLUME={5},

PAGES={37},

YEAR={2012},

URL={https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fninf.2011.00037},

ABSTRACT={Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System (LORIS) is a modular and extensible web-based data management system that integrates all aspects of a multi-center study: from heterogeneous data acquisition (imaging, clinical, behavior, and genetics) to storage, processing, and ultimately dissemination. It provides a secure, user-friendly, and streamlined platform to automate the flow of clinical trials and complex multi-center studies. A subject-centric internal organization allows researchers to capture and subsequently extract all information, longitudinal or cross-sectional, from any subset of the study cohort. Extensive error-checking and quality control procedures, security, data management, data querying, and administrative functions provide LORIS with a triple capability (1) continuous project coordination and monitoring of data acquisition (2) data storage/cleaning/querying, (3) interface with arbitrary external data processing “pipelines.” LORIS is a complete solution that has been thoroughly tested through a full 10 year life cycle of a multi-center longitudinal project<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref> and is now supporting numerous international neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration research projects.}
